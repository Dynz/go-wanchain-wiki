## How to get WAN coins

20-Dec-2017 Update: 
* Github has requested that Gist be no longer used to request test WAN coins.
* Wanchain will work on an alternative scheme to request test WAN coins.
* Meantime, please post your test Wanchain wallet address to Discord [https://discord.gg/3DpeV6W](https://discord.gg/3DpeV6W) under the “#beta_testnet” channel.
