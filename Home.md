# Welcome to Wanchain

---
Wanchain connects and exchanges value between different blockchain ledgers in a distributed manner. It uses the latest cryptographic theories to build a non-proprietary cross-chain protocol and a distributed ledger that records both cross-chain and intra-chain transactions. Any blockchain network, whether a public, private or consortium chain, can integrate with Wanchain to establish connections between different ledgers and perform low cost inter-ledger asset transfers. The Wanchain ledger supports not only smart contracts, but also token exchange privacy protection.

This is an user centric open platform, which is maintained by the people who have faith on "Helping others to Help Themselves" spirit. 

The aim of the Wanchain wiki is to help individuals understand WANCHAIN in aspects of "`Product` , `Technology` & `Community` " in an efficient timely manner and to get real hands-on experience without it being time consuming.
