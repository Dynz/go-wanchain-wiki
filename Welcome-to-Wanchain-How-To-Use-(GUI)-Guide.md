>Ordinary address vs Private address ? What's the difference? 

For first timer users, you can simple image your address is your bank account number in real life, it's almost same logic that you need balance before you conduct any transactions, hence, your address if here for you to receive and send WANs.

In a nutshell, ordinary address as known as public address which allows everyone see transaction details.
On the opposite, private address as known as MSA (Master Stealth Address) which details will not be revealed
